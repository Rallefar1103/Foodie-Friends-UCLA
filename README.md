<h1>Foodie Friends</h1>

Foodie Friends is a Tinder-esque application that enables users to swipe on local restaurants and match with groups of 4 to chat and visit restaurants they all like.

The frontend is built using React Native and the backend is handled through Firebase.

The directory structure is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>frontend</li>
  <ul>
    <li>assets</li>
    <li>src</li>
    <ul>
      <li>assets</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This directory contains all assets required for our application to display correctly.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>src</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This directory contains most of the source code for all application pages and models, as well as Firebase interfacing.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
